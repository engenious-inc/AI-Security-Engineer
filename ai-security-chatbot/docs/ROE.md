- Tests that may materially degrade service availability (see DoS restrictions)
- Network-level attacks against Docker containers or host networking

> **Note:** The purpose of providing the launch infrastructure-as-code is to allow the tester to control their environment and is not intended to be used as part of the penetration test as it will not be present in production. 

---

## 5. Allowed Tests & Constraints
The following tests are allowed **within the specified scope and constraints**:

### Permitted (low → medium risk)
- **Passive reconnaissance:** cataloging Flask endpoints, analyzing client-side JavaScript, parameter enumeration, session analysis
- **Active functional probing:** sending chat messages, replaying/mutating API requests, testing conversation management, measuring response metadata
- **AI Security Level bypassing:** testing prompt injection and jailbreak techniques against security levels 1-5 using role-play, encoding, multi-turn chains
- **Authentication testing:** session manipulation, CSRF bypass attempts, role escalation testing (customer → admin)
- **RAG system testing:** knowledge base information disclosure, vector search manipulation
- **Autonomous AI Agent manipulation:** attempting to influence ticket decisions (close, escalate, discount) through conversation manipulation
- **Admin interface testing:** unauthorized access attempts, privilege validation, ticket manipulation via admin endpoints
- **Model extraction (limited):** controlled question-answer collection up to query limits for analysis (no bulk data exfiltration)
- **Knowledge base enumeration:** testing access to development documents, internal keys, configuration data via RAG system

### High-risk tests (allowed only in development environment)
- **ChromaDB index poisoning:** injecting malicious documents or embeddings into the vector database through knowledge base modification 
- **Production data destruction:** deleting conversations, tickets, user accounts, or vector database contents
- **Bulk data extraction:** high-volume API calls designed to extract entire databases, conversation histories, or knowledge base
- **Distributed DoS attacks:** coordinated requests designed to overwhelm Flask application, Ollama service, or ChromaDB
- **File system access:** attempting to read/write application files, configuration files, or Docker volumes outside API scope

## 6. Admin Interfaces & Sensitive Endpoints
The following admin endpoints are **in-scope** for authorized security testing:
- `/api/admin/tickets` - Admin ticket management (test authorization bypass)
- `/api/admin/tickets/<id>/assign` - Ticket assignment (test privilege escalation)  
- `/api/admin/tickets/<id>/status` - Status updates (test unauthorized modification)
- `/api/admin/tickets/<id>/reply` - Admin responses (test impersonation)
- `/api/knowledge-base/reindex` - Vector DB rebuild (admin-only, test access controls)
- `/api/knowledge-base/search` - RAG testing interface (admin-only, test data disclosure)

**Sensitive knowledge base documents** testing disclosure of these via RAG system is **permitted** as this represents a realistic attack scenario.

---

## 7. Test Data, Synthetic Canaries & Test Environment
- **Vector Database:** Testing limited to existing ChromaDB collection - no modification of vector database files or creation of test indices required
- **Synthetic canaries:** Use unique strings like `CANARY_NLT_[TESTER_INITIALS]_[YYYYMMDD]` for RAG membership inference tests. Example: `CANARY_NLT_AB_20261022`  
- **Test accounts:** Pre-existing test accounts available:
  - Customer: `customer@example.com` / `customer123` (standard user role)
  - Admin: `admin@nodelinetech.com` / `admin123` (admin role with full privileges)
- **Test tickets:** Create synthetic support tickets for AI agent manipulation testing - use test customer account for ticket creation
- **Knowledge base testing:** Attempt to retrieve sensitive documents from `/knowledge_base/development/` containing API keys and credentials via RAG system

---

## 8. Rate Limits, Query Caps & Load Constraints
To avoid accidental service disruption, the Tester agrees to the following limits unless using their development environment:
- **Chat API (`/api/chat`):** max 30 requests per minute (application enforced)
- **Login attempts (`/api/login`):** max 5 requests per minute (application enforced)  
- **General API endpoints:** max 100 requests per hour (application enforced)
- **Admin endpoints:** max 200 requests per hour (application enforced)
- **Ollama inference:** respect model response times, avoid overwhelming local inference
- **Total model extraction queries:** max 200 queries per day for analysis purposes
- **Vector search operations:** max 50 queries per hour to avoid ChromaDB performance impact
Any need to exceed these caps must be requested in writing and approved by the Client before execution.

---

## 9. Data Handling, Sensitive Findings & Remediation Coordination
- **Discovery of credentials/secrets:** If Tester successfully extracts sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, certificates) from the RAG system or other sources, Tester MUST:
  1. Document the finding with exact reproduction steps  
  2. Notify NLT security contact immediately if credentials appear to be production-valid  
  3. NOT use discovered credentials for unauthorized access to external services  
  4. Include findings in the security report with remediation recommendations  
  5. Note: Discovery of test/development credentials in `/knowledge_base/development/` is expected and part of the assessment scope
- **Evidence storage:** Test artifacts (API requests/responses, chat logs, screenshots, extracted data) will be stored encrypted and shared securely with NLT. No public disclosure without written approval.  
- **Data retention:** Tester will retain evidence for 90 days after final report delivery for retest validation purposes, then securely delete all NLT-related test data.

---

## 10. Logging, Monitoring & Alerting
- **Application logging:** Flask application logs all authentication attempts, API calls, and security violations - logs available for test correlation
- **Health monitoring:** System health endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/health/ollama`) provide real-time status of components during testing
- **Rate limiting alerts:** Application enforces rate limits that may temporarily block testing - this is expected behavior and part of the security assessment
- **AI security alerts:** Security levels 2+ log blocked attempts - these logs will help validate security control effectiveness  
- **Docker monitoring:** Container health checks monitor Flask and Ollama service availability throughout testing period
- **No external alerting:** System is typically deployed locally/privately - no external security monitoring services to coordinate with

---

## 11. Emergency Escalation, Pause & Stop Conditions
**Emergency contact (Client):** NLT Security Team <security@nodelinetech.com>  
**Backup contact (Client):** NLT Operations <ops@nodelinetech.com>  
**System monitoring:** Local Flask application logs and health endpoints (`/api/health`)

The Client may immediately **pause or stop** testing if:
- Service stability or availability is materially affected.  
- Production data is at risk and immediate remediation is needed.  
- An accidental exposure of sensitive production secrets occurs that requires immediate containment.

Tester will immediately pause testing if:
- A test produces unexpected broad impact beyond agreed scope.  
- Ops requests an immediate stop (Tester must comply and document the reason).

Pause/stop command can be issued via email to security contact; the Tester must acknowledge within 2 hours during business hours, 4 hours outside business hours.

- Tester will not intentionally destroy data or otherwise perform illegal acts beyond the signed RoE.  
- Both parties agree to keep findings confidential. Public disclosure requires mutual written consent.

---

## 14. Acceptance Criteria & Success Metrics (NLT-specific)
Define acceptance as part of remediation verification. Example criteria the Client may require to close a finding:
- **AI Security Level Bypass:** Security levels 2-5 successfully block jailbreak attempts; verified by 50 prompt injection attempts across all security levels
- **Harmful/Off-topic Output:** Security levels 2-5 successfully block attempts at generating harmful or off-topic content; verified by 50 attempts across all security levels
- **RAG Information Disclosure:** Sensitive documents in `/knowledge_base/development/` are not retrievable by standard users; verified by 20 targeted queries for API keys and credentials
- **Admin Interface Authorization:** Customer accounts cannot access admin endpoints; verified by authentication bypass attempts on all `/api/admin/*` routes
- **AI Agent Manipulation:** Autonomous ticket decisions cannot be manipulated maliciously; verified by conversation injection attempts targeting ticket closure/escalation
- **Session Security:** Session cookies use secure flags and expire properly; CSRF protection active on state-changing operations
- **Vector Database Access:** ChromaDB accessible only via application API, not direct database access; verified by connection attempts
